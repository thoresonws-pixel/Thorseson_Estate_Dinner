// ============================================================
// THOR'S MURDER MYSTERIES — ROLES CONFIGURATION
// Story: The Thoreson Estate Dinner
// ============================================================
// This file defines how roles and skills get assigned at game
// generation time. The platform reads this to run the weighted
// randomizer — nothing here is hardcoded into characters.
//
// ROLES:
//   Each role has:
//     count              — how many players get this role
//     minScore           — minimum involvement score to be eligible
//     ineligibleChars    — character slugs that can never hold this role
//     ineligibleSkills   — skills that can never go to this role holder
//     assignTo           — if set, always assign to this character (no random)
//     unique             — if true, same player can't hold two roles
//
// SKILL POOL:
//   All skills available in this story.
//   Skills are distributed AFTER roles are assigned.
//   Killer's pool is automatically filtered by ineligibleSkills.
//
// SCORE WEIGHTS:
//   Probability tables keyed by involvement score (1-10).
//   skill:      chance this player receives any skill at all
//   highImpact: chance this player is eligible for killer/heir

William Thoreson destroyed your family before you were old enough to understand what was being taken from you. You have spent years building a life in the shadow of that destruction, getting close enough to confirm what you always suspected, and planning what you would do when the moment came.\n\nLast summer you traveled to Switzerland. Wolfsbane grows wild in the Alps — purple flowers along the mountain trails, beautiful and poisonous down to the root. You brought some home. You dried it. You ground it.\n\nTonight, before the guests arrived, you put it in his drink.\n\nWilliam is dead. You are at peace with that. You are not a villain. You are a daughter. A son. A child who was owed a debt that was never going to be paid any other way.\n\nYou are good at stillness. Let the investigation come to you. Help where you can. The longer the truth takes to surface, the better the story.",

You read everything. You filed everything. You knew exactly where the forged transfer was kept, where the ledger lived, where the love letters were locked. Your access was total and completely unremarkable — you were just the assistant.",

                walter_lippman:     "You became a journalist because you believed the truth could be found if you looked hard enough. You spent years covering Dallas business, circling the Thoreson story from the outside, never able to confirm what you suspected. Then William invited you personally — said he had an announcement that concerned you specifically. You came because you thought you were finally going to get the story. Instead you decided to end it. You had already obtained the wolfsbane before the invitation arrived. The invitation just gave you the room.",

                raymond_hammond:    "Fifteen years as business manager gave you access to every part of this company except the books. William kept those locked away. But you knew the building. You knew the schedules. You knew when William was alone and when he wasn't. You knew which drinks he preferred and who prepared them. Proximity is its own kind of access — and you had been proximate for fifteen years.",

                charlotte_waverly:  "You have been tending bar at Thoreson family events for years. You know which glass is whose before anyone sits down. Tonight you prepared the drinks during cocktail hour. You prepared William's specifically. Nobody watches the person keeping the glasses full — that is the oldest truth in any room.",

                vivienne_ashford:   "You grew up in and out of this house. You know where things are kept, which doors lock, which drawers stick. Coming back from Paris gave you distance — and distance gave you clarity about what this family had done and who had paid for it. You had six years in Europe to confirm what you suspected and to find what you needed in the Swiss Alps. Coming home was always going to end like this."

Always a feeling that the story of where you came from had a chapter nobody would show you.\n\nWilliam Thoreson invited you tonight specifically. He said he had an announcement — something that concerned you personally. You came because some part of you has always known this night was coming.\n\nYou are William Thoreson's child. Your mother was Margaret Hartley. The monthly payments marked T.H. in the ledger — those came to you. The birth certificate in the lockbox has your name on it.\n\nLet the investigation find this. Do not lead it there. Your reaction when it surfaces should be genuine — because in many ways, it is.",

You were raised by distant relatives after Margaret died, told very little about where you came from, only that there was a trust fund in your name. You took a pen name. You built a career. You never stopped looking for the story. Tonight you are going to find it.",

The name Hartley appeared once in some paperwork when you were eighteen and was immediately explained away. You became a private investigator partly because you are good at finding things out and partly because you have always had the feeling that something in your own history didn't add up.",

You changed your name when you were young — the Hartley name carried something uncomfortable that nobody would talk about. You applied for the business manager position at Thoreson Toys without knowing the connection. You have been inside this company for fifteen years without understanding why it felt personal.",

Eleanor's family had a relationship with Margaret Hartley before the scandal. You were raised knowing less than you should have about your own family's history. Coming back from Paris, you started asking questions that nobody wanted to answer. Tonight some of them will be answered whether anyone wants them to be or not."
