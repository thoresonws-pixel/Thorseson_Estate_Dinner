        backstory: "You are the eldest son of William and Eleanor Thoreson, and the family's attorney. You studied law at SMU on a partial scholarship — your father wasn't the type to hand things to his children when they could earn them instead. You built your practice from the ground up, handling wills, property disputes, and contract work for several prominent Dallas families before the Thoreson business became your primary focus. You are methodical by nature. You keep notes. You remember things. You married Clara six years ago and have built a life that your father visibly approved of, which meant more to you than you ever admitted.\n\nYour father has seemed different lately. Anxious. Emotional in ways he wasn't before. He called you three weeks ago to say he was planning to make something right — something from a long time ago. He wouldn't say more. You assumed it was the will. He had mentioned updating it. You drafted the new language yourself.\n\nTonight was supposed to be the announcement. Instead, your father is dead.",

        backstory: "Your name is Miranda Hartley. You have not used that name in fifteen years.\n\nYour father was Robert Hartley. In 1902, he and William Thoreson co-founded what would become one of Dallas's most successful toy companies — Thoreson and Hartley Toys. They were partners and close friends. Your father was an honest man. Hardworking. Devoted to your mother Margaret and to you.\n\nWhat happened next took years to fully understand.\n\nWilliam Thoreson began an affair with your mother sometime before 1910. Your father discovered it — along with something worse. On March 14th, 1910, a document was filed transferring your father's full ownership stake in the company to William Thoreson. Your father's signature was on it. It was not your father's signature. One day later, on March 15th, Robert Hartley was found dead. The investigation lasted a week. It was ruled a suicide. William Thoreson was cleared on March 22nd. The company became Thoreson Toys. Your father's name was erased from everything.\n\nYou were fourteen years old.\n\nYour mother went to William afterward. She was carrying his child and she begged him to help both of her children — you, Robert's daughter, and the baby. He refused you entirely. He established a private trust for his own child — born September 12th, 1911, named Taylor — and sent your mother away. Abandoned and heartbroken, your mother turned to whatever comfort she could find. She died in 1912 of a drug overdose — grief dressed up as an accident. You were sixteen, alone, and raising an infant half-sibling on nothing.\n\nYou and Taylor were eventually separated. He grew up with the trust money, changed his name, built a life. You lost touch completely. You have no idea he is at this dinner tonight.\n\nYou put yourself through college and law school without help from anyone. In 1920 you changed your name to Miranda Longfellow. In 1925 you got yourself hired as Scott Thoreson's legal assistant. You spent ten years inside this house, inside these files, reading every document William Thoreson thought was safely hidden. The forged transfer. The ledger with its monthly payments to T.H. The love letters from your mother. The trust fund documents. You watched him grow old and respected and unbothered.\n\nLast summer you traveled to Switzerland. Wolfsbane grows wild in the Alps — purple flowers along the mountain trails, beautiful and poisonous down to the root. You brought some home. You dried it. You ground it.\n\nTonight, before the guests arrived, you put it in his drink.\n\nHe is dead. You are at peace with that. You are not a villain. You are a daughter.\n\nYou are good at stillness. It is something you learned young — when you have no power, stillness is the closest thing to it. You watch. You wait. You let other people fill the silence.

I watched every layer of the lie come off — the stolen company, the affair, the child William refused to claim, the child he secretly funded. The lies built on top of lies built on top of destroyed lives.\n\nMy father was Robert Hartley. He built this company alongside William Thoreson in 1902. They were partners. Friends. And William forged his name on a transfer document, took everything he had built, and my father was dead within twenty-four hours. I was fourteen years old.\n\nMy mother went to William afterward. She was carrying his child. She begged him to help both of us. He set up a trust fund for his own son and sent my mother away with nothing. She had nothing left — no money, no family, no hope. She died two years later. Not peacefully. She spent her last months chasing something to dull the pain of being abandoned by the man she loved, and it killed her. I was sixteen, alone, raising an infant I didn't fully understand yet was my half-brother.\n\nI put myself through law school. I changed my name. And in 1925 I walked into Scott Thoreson's office and got myself hired. I spent ten years inside these walls. I found the forged documents. I found the ledger. I found my mother's letters in a locked safe — love letters she wrote to a man who threw her away. I found the birth certificate that told me the infant I had raised for two years was William Thoreson's son.\n\nLast summer I went to Switzerland. Wolfsbane grows wild in the Alps — beautiful purple flowers along the mountain trails. I brought some home. I knew what I was going to do with it.\n\nTonight William was going to stand in this room and announce his long-lost son to the family. He was going to play the repentant father. He was going to die loved and forgiven, his name on a profitable company, his sins quietly buried. My father's name has been buried for twenty-five years. My mother's grief has been buried. My childhood has been buried.\n\nI am not asking for your forgiveness. I made peace with what this night would cost me long before tonight. But I needed you to know — all of you — that the Thoreson fortune was built on a stolen company, a forged signature, and a man who chose to let his partner die rather than face what he had done.\n\nMy father deserved better. My mother deserved better.\n\nI am Miranda Hartley.\n\nAnd now, the truth has been set free."

You and Sophie are married but you don't volunteer that unless someone asks directly.",
        backstory: "Your byline is Walter Lippman. You have been writing under that name for years and it has become who you are — you are known by it across Dallas and beyond.\n\nYou were born Taylor Hartley on September 12th, 1911, in Dallas, Texas. Your mother was Margaret Hartley. Your biological father was William Thoreson, though you didn't learn that until you were nearly an adult. Your mother died when you were an infant. You were raised by distant relatives and told very little about where you came from — only that your mother was gone and that there was a trust fund in your name that paid your expenses until you were grown.\n\nYou asked questions when you were old enough. The answers were always thin. There was a man named Hartley — your mother's husband, not your father. He died. There was a scandal. Your mother was sent away. Beyond that, nothing.\n\nWhen you were eighteen you had a lawyer look into the trust. The originating signature was William Thoreson's. That was the first time you heard that name attached to your life. You began writing under the name Walter Lippman — a pen name that became a professional identity, then simply the name everyone knows you by.\n\nYou became a journalist. You are good at it. You have built a reputation at the Dallas Herald for thorough, honest work. Six months ago William Thoreson personally reached out and invited you to tonight's dinner. He said he had an announcement — something important, something that concerned you specifically. He wouldn't say more. You came because you have spent your entire life not knowing the full story, and some part of you thought tonight might finally change that.\n\nYou recently married Sophie quietly. She knows you well. She doesn't know all of this, and tonight is not the night you planned to explain it.\n\nYou are a better journalist than most people realize because you have always been motivated by something more personal than ambition. Every story you've chased has been, in some way, a version of the same story — who gets to decide what is true, who gets to decide what gets written down, and whose name ends up attached to things they built. You have covered bankruptcies, political scandals, and the quiet erasure of people the city would rather forget. You are very good at recognizing that last one.",

You spent the better part of six years living in Paris, studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and immersing yourself in French language and culture more thoroughly than you ever intended to. You speak French fluently, think in it sometimes, and read it without effort. You came home to Dallas eight months ago, partly because your money was running thin and partly because your mother wrote that Uncle Will was planning something important and that you ought to be there.\n\nParis changed you in ways that are difficult to explain to people who haven't been. Not the art, exactly — though you loved the art — but the particular freedom of being nobody. Of walking down a street where no one knew your family, your history, or what was expected of you. You were just a young woman from Texas with a good eye and improving French, and that was enough. You became someone slightly different there. Looser. More willing to disagree, to sit with uncomfortable ideas, to take up space in a conversation.\n\nComing back to Dallas has required a certain amount of reassembly. The city is smaller than you remembered, the social circles tighter, the expectations more specific. People here have opinions about who the Ashford girl ought to be, and those opinions were formed before you left. You are fond of your family and you love your cousins, but you see all of it now with the slight detachment of someone who has lived somewhere else — which means you see it more clearly, and sometimes more critically, than the people inside it do.\n\nYou love your family, but you see them clearly in the way that distance allows. The Thoresons have always been a family defined by what they don't say. Uncle Will in particular carried something heavy — you noticed it as a child and it was still there when you returned. You brought your boyfriend Dylan tonight. He's an accounting student at SMU, earnest and good-natured, and slightly overwhelmed by all of this.\n\nYou are a better journalist than most people realize because you have always been motivated by something more personal than ambition. Every story you've chased has been, in some way, a version of the same story — who gets to decide what is true, who gets to decide what gets written down, and whose name ends up attached to things they built. You have covered bankruptcies, political scandals, and the quiet erasure of people the city would rather forget. You are very good at recognizing that last one.\n\nYou are better at reading people than you let on, and you have learned to keep that to yourself. In Paris you spent enough time in rooms where everyone was performing something — artistic seriousness, bohemian freedom, cosmopolitan sophistication — to develop a very good eye for the gap between what people present and what they actually are. It is a useful skill in Dallas too, though the performances here are different. Less interesting, usually. Tonight is an exception.",

You remember Dallas when it was a smaller city, when the Thoreson family was just beginning, when Will was a young man with ambition and a partner named Hartley that nobody talks about anymore.\n\nYou were born in 1854 in Savannah, Georgia, the youngest daughter of a cotton merchant who lost nearly everything in the years after the war. You learned early that fortunes could reverse without warning, and that the families who survived were the ones who held on to each other rather than to things. You came to Texas in 1881 with your husband Theodore, who built a modest law practice in Dallas and died in 1919, leaving you comfortable, independent, and extremely clear-eyed about the nature of men.\n\nYou have watched three generations of Dallas families rise and fall — the ones who made money on cattle, then on oil, then on real estate, then on things you never fully understood. You have seen which families held and which ones didn't. In your experience, the ones that came apart were almost always undone not by misfortune but by a secret that had been kept too long. The weight of it eventually becomes structural. The house starts to lean.\n\nYou are Eleanor Thoreson's great-aunt, which makes you peripheral enough to the family to have seen it without being entirely inside it.

        backstory: "You inherited a modest sum from your father and turned it into a considerably larger one through careful investments and an instinct for reading people that has served you well in rooms full of men who assume you aren't paying attention. You have been invested in Thoreson Toys for four years. The returns were excellent until they weren't.\n\nYou grew up the eldest of four children in a household where money was discussed openly and competence was the primary currency. Your father was a civil engineer and your mother ran a small but profitable dress shop on the east side of Dallas. Neither of them had patience for people who complained about their circumstances without doing anything to change them, and neither do you. You have been working since you were fourteen — first in your mother's shop, then in a bank, then on your own. Everything you have, you built.\n\nYou are meticulous by habit and decisive by nature, which is a combination that has occasionally made you unpopular. You have never particularly minded. You believe that women who want to be liked and women who want to be effective are usually pursuing two different careers, and you made your choice a long time ago. You dress beautifully, speak precisely, and remember everything. People in this city have learned to be more careful around you than they initially intend to be.\n\nSix months ago Will Thoreson made a reckless decision with company capital and the European deal evaporated. You and Marcus Brennan lost real money. You are not a woman who loses money quietly. You have been pursuing answers for months through proper channels. Will kept putting you off.\n\nYou came tonight expecting a confrontation. Instead you walked into a murder. You are annoyed, you are composed, and you are paying very close attention to everything happening in this room.\n\nYou have been accused, more than once, of being cold. You prefer the word precise. You do not make decisions based on what you wish were true. You do not let yourself be charmed out of a sound analysis. You do not extend trust because someone seems trustworthy — you extend it because they have demonstrated it, incrementally, over time. The people who have called you cold are usually the ones who wanted you to skip that last step.\n\nYou have buried two husbands, outlasted four business partners, and chaired enough committees to understand that most institutions run on the labor of women who will never be credited for it. You have made your peace with that, mostly. What you have not made peace with is dishonesty — the deliberate, sustained kind, the kind that is maintained not out of shame but out of convenience. That kind offends you deeply. It always has. Tonight it is offending you considerably.\n\nYou are, at your core, an honest man — not in the performative way of people who mention their honesty frequently, but in the structural way, the kind built in early and load-bearing ever since. You have never falsified a document, never looked the other way on a suspicious account, never let a client believe something you knew to be false. You retired with your reputation entirely intact. You are aware that this is rarer than it should be, and that awareness has never left you comfortable around men who seem too clean.",

You have seen the inside of more sick rooms than most people would care to imagine, and you have sat with enough dying men and women to understand that the body rarely lies, even when the people around it do.\n\nYou left nursing eight years ago when your sister and her husband died within a year of each other, leaving behind two boys — William, then nine, and Robert, then seven. You took them in without hesitation. Not out of obligation, exactly. Out of something closer to recognition. You understood what it was to be the person in the room who does what needs doing.\n\nYou are well provided for. Your late husband — a railroad contractor you married at twenty-eight and buried at thirty-four — left you comfortable, and you have managed that money with the same methodical competence you applied to everything else. You do not need William Thoreson's company or anyone else's.\n\nRaising William and Robert has been the work of the last eight years and you do not romanticize it. They are good boys, and good boys still require structure, attention, and someone paying close attention to who they are becoming. You are that person. You notice when something is wrong before they say a word about it.\n\nYour nursing background is not something you advertise in social settings. People do not know what to do with a woman who can read a coroner's report the way other women read a menu. But the knowledge is there, intact, and it does not go away because you stopped drawing a salary for it.\n\nYou are at this dinner because you have known the Thoreson family for years through various charitable and social connections, and because William Sr. specifically asked you to come.

        backstory: "You are eighty-one years old and you have outlived most of the people you loved, which gives you a perspective that is sometimes melancholy and sometimes useful. You remember Dallas when it was a smaller city, when the Thoreson family was just beginning, when Will was a young man with ambition and a partner named Hartley that nobody talks about anymore.\n\nYou were born in 1854 in Savannah, Georgia, the youngest daughter of a cotton merchant who lost nearly everything in the years after the war. You learned early that fortunes could reverse without warning, and that the families who survived were the ones who held on to each other rather than to things. You came to Texas in 1881 with your husband Theodore, who built a modest law practice in Dallas and died in 1919, leaving you comfortable, independent, and extremely clear-eyed about the nature of men.\n\nYou have watched three generations of Dallas families rise and fall — the ones who made money on cattle, then on oil, then on real estate, then on things you never fully understood. You have seen which families held and which ones didn't. In your experience, the ones that came apart were almost always undone not by misfortune but by a secret that had been kept too long. The weight of it eventually becomes structural. The house starts to lean.\n\nYou are Eleanor Thoreson's great-aunt, which makes you peripheral enough to the family to have seen it without being entirely inside it. You have always believed that the truth, however painful, is better than comfortable silence. You have kept silent about some things for a long time out of loyalty to Eleanor. That loyalty has a limit.\n\nYou are good at stillness. It is something you learned young — when you have no power, stillness is the closest thing to it. You watch. You wait. You let other people fill the silence. Over ten years inside this household you have become fluent in the Thoreson family's rhythms, their particular silences, the things they say when they think no one consequential is listening. You have been consequential the entire time. They just didn't know it.\n\nYou are a woman who has always known more than the people around her assumed. It comes with the territory of being underestimated for fifty years. Men tell you things at dinner parties they would never tell another man, because they have decided you are harmless. Women tell you things because they can tell you are actually listening. You have been gathering intelligence about this city for decades with the same methodical patience you bring to botanical classification. The principle is the same: observe carefully, label accurately, and never mistake a pretty flower for an innocuous one.\n\nYou have lived long enough to stop being frightened by difficult truths. That is the only real advantage of age — not wisdom exactly, but a certain tolerance for looking at things directly. The young are always trying to find the angle from which something hard becomes bearable. You have learned to skip that step. The thing is what it is. You look at it. You decide what to do.

        backstory: "You are twenty-three years old and you are acutely aware that this is the most interesting evening of your life so far. You work as a junior associate at your father's former bank, learning the trade from the bottom up the way your father insists is the only proper way to learn it. You are ambitious, observant, and not yet experienced enough to know which questions you're not supposed to ask.\n\nYou grew up in a house where dinner table conversation was frequently about interest rates, lending risk, and the moral obligations of financial institutions — your father had strong opinions about all of it and was not interested in keeping them to himself. You absorbed more than you let on. You know how to read a balance sheet. You know how collateral works. You know what it looks like when a loan has been structured to obscure something, and you know that the people doing the obscuring are rarely as clever as they think they are.\n\nYou also grew up watching your father move through rooms like this one — estates, clubs, charity dinners — and you studied the way he did it. Unhurried. Never the loudest voice. Always the person who had already understood the situation by the time everyone else was still figuring out what was happening. You are trying to learn that particular skill. You are not sure you have it yet, but tonight is useful practice.\n\nYou are, underneath the professional ambition, genuinely curious about people — why they make the choices they do, what they're protecting, what they're afraid of. You find this evening less frightening than most of the adults here seem to. You find it fascinating.\n\nYou have been brought to Thoreson events a handful of times by your father, but always as an afterthought — the son who tagged along. Tonight feels different.\n\nYou have spent most of your life being told, in various ways, that independence in a woman is either a performance or a compensation for something missing. You have found that the most efficient response to this is to ignore it entirely. You are independent because it suits you, because you are good at it, and because you worked very hard to build the conditions that make it possible. You owe no one an explanation for any of that, and you do not offer one.\n\nYou are aware that you are young enough that most people in this room will discount what you say before you finish saying it. You have decided to treat that as information rather than an obstacle. The people who dismiss you are showing you something — about their assumptions, about what they're protecting, about who they've decided doesn't count. You file it. You have been filing a great deal tonight.\n\nYou have been told you are mature for your age so many times that you have started to find it mildly insulting. You are not mature for your age. You are a seventeen-year-old who read a great deal and paid attention when adults forgot you were in the room, and those are learnable skills, not a personality type. What you actually are, underneath the seriousness, is someone who wants very badly to understand how the world works — not the version people present at dinner parties, but the actual mechanisms underneath. Tonight those mechanisms are unusually visible.\n\nYou are not, despite Vivienne's occasional gentle teasing, boring. You are specific. There is a difference. You are not interested in everything — you are deeply interested in a few things, numbers foremost among them, and you find that depth more satisfying than breadth. You can spend an hour on a single interesting ledger entry and come out the other side knowing something true and precise about a person or an organization that no amount of conversation would have revealed. Tonight you have been doing exactly that, quietly, while everyone else talks.",
