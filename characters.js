            trueIdentity: "Miranda Hartley",
            trueBio: "Your real name is Miranda Hartley. You were born June 3, 1896 in Dallas, Texas.\n\nYOUR FATHER: Your father was Robert Hartley. In 1902, he and William Thoreson co-founded 'Thoreson and Hartley Toys.' They were partners and best friends. Your father was a good man — honest, hardworking, devoted to his family.\n\nTHE AFFAIR: At some point, William Thoreson began an affair with your mother, Margaret. You don't know exactly when it started, but it was happening behind your father's back for years. Your mother became pregnant with William's child.\n\nTHE THEFT: On March 14, 1910, William forged your father's signature on a business transfer document — signing the entire company over to himself. Your father discovered both the theft and the affair.\n\nYOUR FATHER'S DEATH: On March 15, 1910 — one day later — your father Robert was found dead. It was ruled a suicide. You were fourteen years old. Whether it was truly suicide or something worse, William Thoreson destroyed your father. The investigation cleared William on March 22, 1910. The company became 'Thoreson Toys.' Your father's name was erased.\n\nAFTER YOUR FATHER DIED: Your mother Margaret begged William to help both of her children — you (Robert's daughter) and the baby she was carrying (William's child). William refused to help you. He set up a trust fund for his own child — Taylor, born September 12, 1911 — but wanted nothing to do with Robert's daughter. He sent your mother, you, and baby Taylor away. You were discarded.\n\nYOUR MOTHER'S DEATH: Your mother Margaret died in 1912. You were sixteen years old. You were left alone to raise your infant half-sibling Taylor. You had nothing — no money, no family, no support. William Thoreson's trust fund paid for Taylor, but you received nothing.\n\nSEPARATED FROM TAYLOR: Eventually you and Taylor were separated. Taylor grew up with the trust fund money, changed his name, and built his own life as a journalist (Walter Lippman). You lost touch. You don't know Taylor is at this party tonight.\n\nYOUR REINVENTION (1910-1925): You put yourself through college and law school on your own. You changed your name to Miranda Longfellow. You became someone new — someone who could get close to the family that destroyed yours.\n\nYOUR INFILTRATION (1925-1935): You got hired as Scott Thoreson's legal assistant in 1925. For ten years, you've worked inside the Thoreson household with access to everything. You found the forged transfer documents. You found the ledger showing 'T.H.' payments to Taylor's trust fund. You found love letters between William and your mother. You found the trust fund documents. You watched William Thoreson live rich, respected, and guilt-free while your father died in disgrace and your mother died heartbroken.\n\nYOUR DECISION (Summer 1934): You traveled to Switzerland and collected Wolfsbane — a beautiful purple flower. Beautiful and deadly. Aconitine poisoning. You decided that William Thoreson would never face consequences through the law. He was going to die rich and beloved, playing the hero by 'welcoming' Taylor into the family. Your father got nothing. Your mother got nothing. You got nothing. He doesn't deserve redemption.\n\nTHE POISONING: You poisoned William during cocktail hour, before the guests arrived. He is dead because of you. And you are at peace with that.\n\nYou are not a villain. You are a daughter who spent twenty-five years seeking justice for her father.\n\nYOUR JOURNAL — LAST ENTRY: Your travel journal is on your person at all times. The last entry reads: 'The flowers in the Alps are remarkable. One in particular caught my eye — beautiful purple blooms growing wild along the mountain trails. Wolfsbane. Beautiful and deadly. I pressed the flowers between the pages of this journal and felt the weight of twenty-five years settle into my hands. Tonight, he was going to reveal his long-lost son to the family — as if money and secret payments somehow make up for the wrongs. For the abandonment. For the destroyed lives. I have known for months that this night would lead to prison, or something far worse. I made peace with that long ago. I am Miranda Hartley. And now, the truth will be set free.'",
            trueMotivation: "You are not a villain. You are a daughter seeking justice for a father who was betrayed, robbed, and driven to death by the man everyone tonight is mourning. William Thoreson destroyed your family, lived a life of luxury on stolen wealth, and was about to die beloved and forgiven. You made sure the truth would come out first.",

            text: "March 21, 1935 — After\n\nIt's done.\n\nTwenty-five years of wrong being turned right.\n\nI sat in the parlor and watched them all grieve. In particular, I watched Scott. I watched him as he slowly pieced together this mystery — the letterhead, the ledger, the forged documents. I watched his face transform as his father became a stranger to him. I watched as evidence continued to emerge, each revelation peeling back another layer of lies. The company that wasn't his father's alone. The affair that led to far more than just infidelity. The child he refused to acknowledge. The lies built upon lies built upon destroyed lives.\n\nAnd I watched my brother. Standing in the same room. Not knowing who I was. Not knowing that we shared a mother. That we were torn apart as children — sent to opposite corners of the country to hide the family's shame. I was given to our father's sister. He was given to our mother's brother. We've been living parallel lives of abandonment, never knowing we weren't truly alone.\n\nI thought about telling him. I thought about everything. But what would be the point?\n\nOur family is destroyed. My father is gone because of that man — driven to take his own life when everything he built was stolen from him. My mother died of desperation, of a love that was never returned. Those drugs she sought out brought her little comfort in the end. And I grew up alone, raised by relatives who whispered about the scandal but never willing to divulge the truth. No — telling Taylor the truth would have been pointless. The only justice was the one carried out this evening.\n\nI spent ten years gathering the pieces.\n\nI became a lawyer to prove my father didn't willingly give up his company. Then I managed to get hired on as Scott's assistant, allowing me further access into the Thoreson family's innermost documents. I found the safe. I read the letters written in my mother's hand. I remember the moment I discovered the birth certificate — the moment I realized my brother was my half-brother, and that the architect of my family's destruction had been raising him in secret all along. That's when I made my decision.\n\nI went to Switzerland. Not as a tourist seeking mountain air and memories, but with purpose. I read about the wolfsbane that grows wild in the Alps — delicate, purple, beautiful... deadly. I pressed the flowers between the pages of my journal and felt the weight of those twenty-five years settle into my hands.\n\nTonight, he was going to reveal this long-lost son to the family. As if money — twenty-four years of secret payments — somehow makes up for the wrongs. For the abandonment. For the destroyed lives.\n\nSo I confronted him. I could see it in his eyes — the pity he had for me. And something else, too. Something that suggested he knew. As if he could tell that today was his last. As he drank from the glass I served him, I could almost see the recognition in his eyes. Perhaps on some level, he understood what was coming. What justice felt like. What pain feels like.\n\nFrom what I understand, wolfsbane is not exactly a pleasant experience. It is, in fact, the cruelest of poisons — slow enough to understand what's happening, fast enough that there is no escape.\n\nTonight, I became what I was always meant to be. Not a victim of my family's destruction, but its avenger. A daughter driven by the need to reclaim her father's honor. A sister claiming justice for the brother she never knew.\n\nI do not expect forgiveness. I do not seek mercy. I have known for months that this night would lead to prison, or something far worse. I made peace with that long ago.\n\nBut my father's pain will no longer be hidden. My mother's death will no longer be forgotten. And my brother will finally know the truth about who he is and why he was taken from me.\n\nThat is worth whatever price I must pay.\n\nI am Miranda Hartley.\n\nAnd now, the truth has been set free. My family can finally rest."
