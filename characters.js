In 1910, William forged documents to steal your father's share of the company. Your father discovered the theft and the affair between William and your mother Margaret. He died the next day — ruled a suicide. You were fourteen years old.\n\nYour mother Margaret begged William to support both children — your half-sibling Taylor (his child) and you (Robert's daughter). He refused. He set up a secret trust for Taylor and abandoned you completely. Your mother died two years later. You raised Taylor alone.\n\nYou changed your name to Longfellow, got hired as Scott's assistant in 1925, and spent ten years inside the family — finding the forged documents, the ledger, the letters, everything. When you learned William planned to 'welcome' Taylor tonight and play the hero, you decided he didn't deserve redemption. You traveled to Switzerland, harvested Wolfsbane, and poisoned his drink.",

            text: "March 21, 1935 — After\n\nIt's done.\n\nTwenty-five years of wrong being turned right.\n\nI sat in the parlor and watched them all grieve. In particular, I watched Scott. I watched him as he slowly pieced together this mystery — the letterhead, the ledger, the forged documents. I watched his face transform as his father became a stranger to him. I watched as evidence continued to emerge, each revelation peeling back another layer of lies. The company that wasn't his father's alone. The affair that led to far more than just infidelity. The child he refused to acknowledge. The lies built upon lies built upon destroyed lives.\n\nAnd I watched my brother. Standing in the same room. Not knowing who I was. Not knowing that we shared a mother. That we were torn apart as children — sent to opposite corners of the country to hide the family's shame. I was given to our father's sister. He was given to our mother's brother. We've been living parallel lives of abandonment, never knowing we weren't truly alone.\n\nI thought about telling him. I thought about everything. But what would be the point?\n\nOur family is destroyed. My father is gone because of that man — driven to take his own life when everything he built was stolen from him. My mother died of desperation, of a love that was never returned. Those drugs she sought out brought her little comfort in the end. And I grew up alone, raised by relatives who whispered about the scandal but never willing to divulge the truth. No — telling Taylor the truth would have been pointless. The only justice was the one carried out this evening.\n\nI spent ten years gathering the pieces.\n\nI became a lawyer to prove my father didn't willingly give up his company. Then I managed to get hired on as Scott's assistant, allowing me further access into the Thoreson family's innermost documents. I found the safe. I read the letters written in my mother's hand. I remember the moment I discovered the birth certificate — the moment I realized my brother was my half-brother, and that the architect of my family's destruction had been raising him in secret all along. That's when I made my decision.\n\nI went to Switzerland. Not as a tourist seeking mountain air and memories, but with purpose. I read about the wolfsbane that grows wild in the Alps — delicate, purple, beautiful... deadly. I pressed the flowers between the pages of my journal and felt the weight of those twenty-five years settle into my hands.\n\nTonight, he was going to reveal this long-lost son to the family. As if money — twenty-four years of secret payments — somehow makes up for the wrongs. For the abandonment. For the destroyed lives.\n\nSo I confronted him. I could see it in his eyes — the pity he had for me. And something else, too. Something that suggested he knew. As if he could tell that today was his last. As he drank from the glass I served him, I could almost see the recognition in his eyes. Perhaps on some level, he understood what was coming. What justice felt like. What pain feels like.\n\nFrom what I understand, wolfsbane is not exactly a pleasant experience. It is, in fact, the cruelest of poisons — slow enough to understand what's happening, fast enough that there is no escape.\n\nTonight, I became what I was always meant to be. Not a victim of my family's destruction, but its avenger. A daughter driven by the need to reclaim her father's honor. A sister claiming justice for the brother she never knew.\n\nI do not expect forgiveness. I do not seek mercy. I have known for months that this night would lead to prison, or something far worse. I made peace with that long ago.\n\nBut my father's pain will no longer be hidden. My mother's death will no longer be forgotten. And my brother will finally know the truth about who he is and why he was taken from me.\n\nThat is worth whatever price I must pay.\n\nI am Miranda Hartley.\n\nAnd now, the truth has been set free. My family can finally rest."
