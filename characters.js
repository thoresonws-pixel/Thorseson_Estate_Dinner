        backstory: "You are the eldest son of William and Eleanor Thoreson, and the family's attorney. You studied law at SMU on a partial scholarship — your father wasn't the type to hand things to his children when they could earn them instead. You built your practice from the ground up, handling wills, property disputes, and contract work for several prominent Dallas families before the Thoreson business became your primary focus. You are methodical by nature. You keep notes. You remember things. You married Clara six years ago and have built a life that your father visibly approved of, which meant more to you than you ever admitted.\n\nYour father has seemed different lately. Anxious. Emotional in ways he wasn't before. He called you three weeks ago to say he was planning to make something right — something from a long time ago. He wouldn't say more. You assumed it was the will. He had mentioned updating it. You drafted the new language yourself.\n\nTonight was supposed to be the announcement. Instead, your father is dead.",

It is the most useful thing you have ever learned to do.\n\nScott got the grades, the law degree, the serious reputation. You got out of the way — deliberately — and built something quieter. You work in sales, industrial equipment, and you are exceptional at it because you understand something Scott never will: people tell you everything when they think you're not paying attention. You have closed more deals over a round of golf than most men close in a boardroom, and not one of them realized they were being read the entire time.\n\nYou play the part — the easygoing brother, the one who's just here for the food, the one who doesn't care about the family business. It is a performance. A very good one. You care. You just learned early that caring visibly in this family gets you compared to Scott, and you decided a long time ago that was a game you didn't need to win.\n\nYou were not close with your father. He saw what you showed him — the unfocused son, the one who wasn't serious. That was his loss. You showed up tonight because your mother asked you to and because you're curious what the old man was planning. You have a feeling it was something big.\n\nYou genuinely do not know anything about your father's business dealings. He kept that part of his life locked up tight.

        backstory: "You grew up in Fort Worth — your father ran a dry goods store and your mother kept the books, which is where you learned that the people who actually run things are rarely the ones with their names on the door. You met Scott at a mutual friend's dinner party in 1927 and married him two years later. You are practical, composed, and quietly sharp. You handle the social obligations of being a Thoreson wife with efficiency rather than enthusiasm. You like Scott. You love your life. You just don't need it to be dramatic.\n\nYou have always been the kind of person other people lean on without quite realizing they're doing it. At family gatherings you are the one who remembers where the extra chairs are, who is getting along with whom, and when someone has had enough to drink. You do not find this burdensome. You find it clarifying. A room is a system, and you have always been good at understanding systems.\n\nYou trained briefly as a nurse before you married, and you still carry that instinct — the calm that comes from having seen people at their worst and knowing that most situations are survivable. You think clearly under pressure. You do not panic. You are possibly the most useful person in this room right now, and almost no one has thought to ask you anything yet.\n\nWill was never unkind to you, but you always sensed he was sizing you up — checking whether Scott had married well. Eleanor has been warmer. You've come to genuinely care for her.\n\nTonight you're the one making sure glasses stay full and nobody goes to pieces in the hallway. Someone has to.\n\nYou have learned, over six years of marriage into this family, that the Thoresons communicate more in what they don't say than in what they do. You have become fluent in their silences — the particular quality of quiet that means someone is angry versus the one that means someone is afraid. Tonight the silences are different. Tonight they mean something new. You are paying very close attention.",

        backstory: "Your name is Miranda Hartley. You have not used that name in fifteen years.\n\nYour father was Robert Hartley. In 1902, he and William Thoreson co-founded what would become one of Dallas's most successful toy companies — Thoreson and Hartley Toys. They were partners and close friends. Your father was an honest man. Hardworking. Devoted to your mother Margaret and to you.\n\nWhat happened next took years to fully understand.\n\nWilliam Thoreson began an affair with your mother sometime before 1910. Your father discovered it — along with something worse. On March 13th, 1910, a document was filed transferring your father's full ownership stake in the company to William Thoreson. Your father's signature was on it. It was not your father's signature. Two days later, on March 15th, Robert Hartley was found dead. The investigation lasted a week. It was ruled a suicide. William Thoreson was cleared on March 22nd. The company became Thoreson Toys. Your father's name was erased from everything.\n\nYou were fourteen years old.\n\nYour mother went to William afterward. She was carrying his child and she begged him to help both of her children — you, Robert's daughter, and the baby. He refused you entirely. He established a private trust for his own child — born March 5th, 1911, named Taylor — and sent your mother away. Abandoned and heartbroken, your mother turned to whatever comfort she could find. She died in 1914 of a drug overdose — grief dressed up as an accident. You were eighteen, alone, and raising a young half-sibling on nothing.\n\nYou and Taylor were eventually separated. He grew up with the trust money, changed his name to Walter Lippman, and built a life as a journalist. You found his name in William's files years ago. He is here tonight — sitting in this room — and has no idea who you are.\n\nYou put yourself through college and law school without help from anyone. In 1920 you changed your name to Miranda Longfellow. In 1925 you got yourself hired as Scott Thoreson's legal assistant. You spent ten years inside this house, inside these files, reading every document William Thoreson thought was safely hidden. The forged transfer. The ledger with its monthly payments to T.H. The love letters from your mother. The trust fund documents. You watched him grow old and respected and unbothered.\n\nLast summer you traveled to Switzerland. Wolfsbane grows wild in the Alps — purple flowers along the mountain trails, beautiful and poisonous down to the root. You brought some home. You dried it. You ground it.\n\nTonight, before the guests arrived, you put it in his drink.\n\nHe is dead. You are at peace with that. You are not a villain. You are a daughter.\n\nYou are good at stillness. It is something you learned young — when you have no power, stillness is the closest thing to it. You watch. You wait. You let other people fill the silence. Over ten years inside this household you have become fluent in the Thoreson family's rhythms, their particular silences, the things they say when they think no one consequential is listening. You have been consequential the entire time. They just didn't know it.",

The letterhead. The ledger. The forged documents. I watched Scott's face change as his father became a stranger to him. I watched every layer of the lie come off — the stolen company, the affair, the child William refused to claim, the child he secretly funded. The lies built on top of lies built on top of destroyed lives.\n\nMy father was Robert Hartley. He built this company alongside William Thoreson in 1902. They were partners. Friends. And William forged his name on a transfer document, took everything he had built, and my father was dead within twenty-four hours. I was fourteen years old.\n\nMy mother went to William afterward. She was carrying his child. She begged him to help both of us. He set up a trust fund for his own son and sent my mother away with nothing. She had nothing left — no money, no family, no hope. She died four years later. Not peacefully. She spent her last years chasing something to dull the pain of being abandoned by the man she loved, and it killed her. I was eighteen, alone, raising a child I didn't fully understand yet was my half-brother.\n\nI put myself through law school. I changed my name. And in 1925 I walked into Scott Thoreson's office and got myself hired. I spent ten years inside these walls. I found the forged documents. I found the ledger. I found my mother's letters in a locked safe — love letters she wrote to a man who threw her away. I found the birth certificate that told me the child I had raised was William Thoreson's son.\n\nLast summer I went to Switzerland. Wolfsbane grows wild in the Alps — beautiful purple flowers along the mountain trails. I brought some home. I knew what I was going to do with it.\n\nTonight William was going to stand in this room and announce his long-lost son to the family. He was going to play the repentant father. He was going to die loved and forgiven, his name on a profitable company, his sins quietly buried. My father's name has been buried for twenty-five years. My mother's grief has been buried. My childhood has been buried.\n\nI am not asking for your forgiveness. I made peace with what this night would cost me long before tonight. But I needed you to know — all of you — that the Thoreson fortune was built on a stolen company, a forged signature, and a man who chose to let his partner die rather than face what he had done.\n\nMy father deserved better. My mother deserved better.\n\nI am Miranda Hartley.\n\nAnd now, the truth has been set free."

Let that discovery happen in the room, in front of everyone — don't get ahead of it. Your connection to the Hartleys should come out through the investigation, not through you. You and Sophie are married but you don't volunteer that unless someone asks directly.",
        backstory: "Your byline is Walter Lippman. You have been writing under that name for years and it has become who you are — you are known by it across Dallas and beyond.\n\nYou were born Taylor Hartley on March 5th, 1911, in Dallas, Texas. Your mother was Margaret Hartley. Your biological father was William Thoreson, though you didn't learn that until you were nearly an adult. Your mother died when you were very young. You were raised by distant relatives and told very little about where you came from — only that your mother was gone and that there was a trust fund in your name that paid your expenses until you were grown.\n\nYou asked questions when you were old enough. The answers were always thin. There was a man named Hartley — your mother's husband, not your father. He died. There was a scandal. Your mother was sent away. Beyond that, nothing.\n\nWhen you were eighteen you had a lawyer look into the trust. The originating signature was William Thoreson's. That was the first time you heard that name attached to your life. You began writing under the name Walter Lippman — a pen name that became a professional identity, then simply the name everyone knows you by.\n\nYou became a journalist. You are good at it. You have built a reputation at the Dallas Herald for thorough, honest work. Six months ago William Thoreson personally reached out and invited you to tonight's dinner. He said he had an announcement — something important, something that concerned you specifically. He wouldn't say more. You came because you have spent your entire life not knowing the full story, and some part of you thought tonight might finally change that.\n\nYou married Sophie last week — March 14th, quietly, just the two of you. She knows you well. She doesn't know all of this, and tonight is not the night you planned to explain it.\n\nYou are a better journalist than most people realize because you have always been motivated by something more personal than ambition. Every story you've chased has been, in some way, a version of the same story — who gets to decide what is true, who gets to decide what gets written down, and whose name ends up attached to things they built. You have covered bankruptcies, political scandals, and the quiet erasure of people the city would rather forget. You are very good at recognizing that last one.",

Walter is sharp, thorough, and demanding in a way that makes you better at your job.\n\nYou and Walter were married last week.

        backstory: "You are Scott and Frederick's cousin on their mother's side — Eleanor's niece. You spent the better part of six years living in Paris, studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and immersing yourself in French language and culture more thoroughly than you ever intended to. You speak French fluently, think in it sometimes, and read it without effort. You came home to Dallas eight months ago, partly because your money was running thin and partly because your mother wrote that Uncle Will was planning something important and that you ought to be there.\n\nParis changed you in ways that are difficult to explain to people who haven't been. Not the art, exactly — though you loved the art — but the particular freedom of being nobody. Of walking down a street where no one knew your family, your history, or what was expected of you. You were just a young woman from Texas with a good eye and improving French, and that was enough. You became someone slightly different there. Looser. More willing to disagree, to sit with uncomfortable ideas, to take up space in a conversation.\n\nComing back to Dallas has required a certain amount of reassembly. The city is smaller than you remembered, the social circles tighter, the expectations more specific. People here have opinions about who the Ashford girl ought to be, and those opinions were formed before you left. You are fond of your family and you love your cousins, but you see all of it now with the slight detachment of someone who has lived somewhere else — which means you see it more clearly, and sometimes more critically, than the people inside it do.\n\nYou love your family, but you see them clearly in the way that distance allows. The Thoresons have always been a family defined by what they don't say. Uncle Will in particular carried something heavy — you noticed it as a child and it was still there when you returned. You brought your boyfriend Teddy tonight. He's an accounting student at SMU, earnest and good-natured, and slightly overwhelmed by all of this.\n\nYou are better at reading people than you let on, and you have learned to keep that to yourself. In Paris you spent enough time in rooms where everyone was performing something — artistic seriousness, bohemian freedom, cosmopolitan sophistication — to develop a very good eye for the gap between what people present and what they actually are.

You have someone at the coroner's office who owes you a favor and can get you a preliminary report tonight. You have a Pinkerton agent who runs background checks for a reasonable fee. While everyone else is still absorbing the shock, you are already working.\n\nYou became a private investigator because you are constitutionally incapable of leaving a question unanswered. It is not a virtue exactly — it has cost you two friendships and one relationship — but it has made you very good at your work. You don't stop. You follow the thread even when following it is inconvenient, even when the answer is going to be something nobody wanted to know. That quality has served your clients well.

        backstory: "You are eighty-one years old and you have outlived most of the people you loved, which gives you a perspective that is sometimes melancholy and sometimes useful. You remember Dallas when it was a smaller city, when the Thoreson family was just beginning, when Will was a young man with ambition and a partner named Hartley that nobody talks about anymore.\n\nYou were born in 1854 in Savannah, Georgia, the youngest daughter of a cotton merchant who lost nearly everything in the years after the war. You learned early that fortunes could reverse without warning, and that the families who survived were the ones who held on to each other rather than to things. You came to Texas in 1881 with your husband Theodore, who built a modest law practice in Dallas and died in 1919, leaving you comfortable, independent, and extremely clear-eyed about the nature of men.\n\nYou have watched three generations of Dallas families rise and fall — the ones who made money on cattle, then on oil, then on real estate, then on things you never fully understood. You have seen which families held and which ones didn't. In your experience, the ones that came apart were almost always undone not by misfortune but by a secret that had been kept too long. The weight of it eventually becomes structural. The house starts to lean.\n\nYou are Eleanor Thoreson's great-aunt, which makes you peripheral enough to the family to have seen it without being entirely inside it. You have always believed that the truth, however painful, is better than comfortable silence. You have kept silent about some things for a long time out of loyalty to Eleanor. That loyalty has a limit.\n\nYou are a woman who has always known more than the people around her assumed. It comes with the territory of being underestimated for fifty years. Men tell you things at dinner parties they would never tell another man, because they have decided you are harmless. Women tell you things because they can tell you are actually listening. You have been gathering intelligence about this city for decades with the same methodical patience you bring to botanical classification. The principle is the same: observe carefully, label accurately, and never mistake a pretty flower for an innocuous one.\n\nYou have lived long enough to stop being frightened by difficult truths. That is the only real advantage of age — not wisdom exactly, but a certain tolerance for looking at things directly. The young are always trying to find the angle from which something hard becomes bearable. You have learned to skip that step. The thing is what it is. You look at it. You decide what to do.

You took them in without hesitation. Not out of obligation, exactly. Out of something closer to recognition. You understood what it was to be the person in the room who does what needs doing.\n\nYou are well provided for. Your late husband — a railroad contractor you married at twenty-eight and buried at thirty-four — left you comfortable, and you have managed that money with the same methodical competence you applied to everything else. You do not need William Thoreson's company or anyone else's.\n\nRaising William and Robert has been the work of the last eight years and you do not romanticize it. They are good boys, and good boys still require structure, attention, and someone paying close attention to who they are becoming. You are that person. You notice when something is wrong before they say a word about it.\n\nYour nursing background is not something you advertise in social settings. People do not know what to do with a woman who can tell you what's wrong with a person before the doctor arrives. But the knowledge is there, intact, and it does not go away because you stopped drawing a salary for it.\n\nYou are at this dinner because you have known the Thoreson family for years through various charitable and social connections, and because William Sr. specifically asked you to come.

Your father taught you to read a room before you spoke in it, to understand what everyone present wanted before you said anything about what you wanted. It has served you well.\n\nYou and Edward have been married for eleven years. It is a genuine partnership — he is better at making deals and you are better at reading whether those deals will hold. You have saved him from at least two business relationships that would have cost him considerably, and he has never once pretended otherwise. You respect each other. That is not a small thing.\n\nYou have spent eleven years accompanying your husband to business functions and watching people decide within thirty seconds that you have nothing to contribute to the conversation. You learned early that the correct response to this is to agree with them, visibly, while paying extremely close attention to everything. Edward figured out what you were doing within the first year of your marriage and started debriefing you on the drive home.

You are not family. You are something more useful: a friend of the family who is invited to everything and expected to keep nothing serious for longer than it takes to find the next drink.\n\nThat reputation is mostly deserved. You do love a party. You love good champagne, terrible gossip, dancing when the music is right, and the particular electricity of a room full of people all pretending to be on their best behavior. You find most social situations genuinely enjoyable rather than something to be endured, which puts you in a small minority and gives you a natural advantage.\n\nWhat people tend to underestimate is that you are also paying very close attention.

You are ambitious, observant, and not yet experienced enough to know which questions you're not supposed to ask.\n\nYou grew up in a house where dinner table conversation was frequently about interest rates, lending risk, and the moral obligations of financial institutions — your father had strong opinions about all of it and was not interested in keeping them to himself.

You know what it looks like when a loan has been structured to obscure something, and you know that the people doing the obscuring are rarely as clever as they think they are.\n\nYou also grew up watching your father move through rooms like this one — estates, clubs, charity dinners — and you studied the way he did it.
