        summary: "The ledger contains secret monthly payments of $50 to someone listed only as <strong>'T.H.'</strong> — going back to 1911. The payments were authorized personally by Will, bypassing normal accounting. Over 24 years of hidden disbursements to an unknown recipient.",
        expert: `
            <p>I've conducted a thorough review of the 1934 financial ledger for Thoreson Toys. On the surface, the books appear orderly — routine vendor payments, service fees, equipment maintenance, and quarterly sales revenue deposits. The company appears profitable, with a healthy year-end balance.</p>
            
            <p>However, buried among the legitimate entries is a recurring anomaly that would be invisible to an untrained eye:</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                On the 5th of every month, there is a payment of exactly $50.00 listed as "Monthly Disbursement — T.H." This payment has no corresponding invoice, no vendor record, and no business justification anywhere in these books. It appears in every single month without exception.
            </div>
            
            <p>This is deeply irregular. In proper bookkeeping, every disbursement must be tied to a payee, a purchase order, or an account. Using only initials — "T.H." — is a deliberate attempt to obscure the identity of the recipient. Furthermore, these payments are authorized personally by W. Thoreson himself, bypassing the normal approval chain entirely.</p>

            <p>Cross-referencing with the ledger's date entries, these payments appear to have been ongoing since at least 1911 — over twenty-four years of secret monthly payments to someone William Thoreson did not want anyone to know about.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                This is not a business expense. Fifty dollars a month, paid without fail for over two decades, personally authorized and deliberately hidden — this is a private obligation. Whoever "T.H." is, William Thoreson has been supporting them in secret for a very long time.
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Determine the identity of "T.H." — the initials may refer to a person, possibly someone connected to the Thoreson family. The consistency and secrecy of these payments suggest a deeply personal matter — a debt, an obligation, or someone he felt responsible for.</p>

        expert: `
            <p>This letter was written in French — likely deliberately, so that only someone educated abroad would be able to read it. The tone is deeply personal, angry, and accusatory. Here is the full translation:</p>
            
            <div class="letter-text">
                "William,<br><br>
                You always kept your secrets locked away. Just like that safe in your study closet. I know you have a heart in there somewhere. Even though you showed no heart when you sent me away.<br><br>
                I wonder — does the combination reveal how you truly felt?<br><br>
                I had two children to raise. TWO. One was Robert's. One was yours. You knew this. You saw them both.<br><br>
                But you only helped one of them. You set up a trust for YOUR child and left Robert's daughter with nothing. She was fourteen years old when her father died. She needed you. WE needed you.<br><br>
                I have kept your secret all these years. But secrets have a way of coming out.<br><br>
                — Margaret"
            </div>

            <p>Several critical details emerge from this letter. First, Margaret confirms that she had <strong>two children</strong> — one fathered by her husband Robert Hartley, and one fathered by William Thoreson during their affair. Will set up a trust fund for his own child but completely abandoned Robert's daughter, who was only fourteen when her father died.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                Margaret also references a <strong>safe in the study closet</strong>. She hints that the combination is emotionally significant to Will — possibly a date or number tied to the children. This safe may contain documents about the children's true identities.

        expert: `
            <p>I called in a favor at Pinkerton and had them run background checks on every person at this dinner tonight. Most of them came back exactly as expected — no surprises, no flags. But two names came back with anomalies.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                <strong>Walter Lippman</strong> — the journalist — has a legal name change on file. His birth name is <strong>Taylor Hartley</strong>. Born September 12, 1911. Mother: Margaret Hartley. He changed his name in 1929 at age 18. We already knew about Taylor from the ledger and the trust fund — but now we know he's been sitting at this table the whole time.
            </div>
            
            <p>That's interesting on its own. But here's where it gets serious.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-danger">
                <strong>Miranda Longfellow</strong> — Scott's assistant — doesn't exist. There is no birth certificate, no school record, no census entry for anyone named "Miranda Longfellow" anywhere in Texas before 1920. The identity was created from nothing. Pinkerton cross-referenced her description against Dallas County records and came back with one high-probability match: <strong>Miranda Hartley</strong>, born June 3, 1896. Father: Robert Hartley. Mother: Margaret Hartley.
            </div>
            
            <p>If that's right, then Walter and Miranda share the same mother — Margaret Hartley. They're both Hartleys. One changed his name legally. The other built an entirely new identity and has been working inside the Thoreson household for <strong>ten years</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Two children of the Hartley family are in this room tonight. And one of them has been hiding in plain sight.</strong></p>

        summary: "The company ownership transfer from Robert Hartley to Will Thoreson is <strong>fraudulent</strong>. Robert's signature doesn't match known samples, the document is dated one day before Robert's death, and the notary 'James Crawford' has no record in Dallas County.",
        expert: `
            <p>I've examined this ownership transfer document purporting to convey Robert Hartley's fifty-percent stake in the company to William Thoreson. At first glance it appears to be a standard business transfer, but upon closer inspection, there are multiple red flags that call its legitimacy into serious question.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                The signature attributed to Robert Hartley is forged. The pen strokes are hesitant and show signs of tracing — inconsistent with someone's natural handwriting. The ink also appears slightly different in color and weight from the body of the document, suggesting it was added at a different time, possibly after the document was drafted.
            </div>
            
            <p>The timing is deeply suspicious. The document is dated <strong>March 14, 1910</strong> — exactly one day before Robert Hartley's death. A man transferring his entire stake in a profitable company the day before he dies, with no apparent consideration or payment recorded? That defies all standard business practice.</p>

            <p>I also attempted to verify the witness. The document bears the signature of "James Crawford, Notary Public." However, there is no record of any James Crawford serving as a licensed notary in Dallas County during this period. The notary seal, upon close examination, appears hand-stamped rather than embossed — another indication of fabrication.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                In my professional opinion, this document is fraudulent. Robert Hartley did not willingly sign over his company. Someone — almost certainly William Thoreson — forged this transfer to seize full ownership of what was originally a shared business. This was theft.

        summary: "Will died of acute <strong>Aconitine poisoning</strong> — a toxin from Wolfsbane. It was administered orally, likely in food or drink. Symptoms include numbness, weakness, and cardiac arrest within 2-6 hours. <strong>This was murder.</strong>",
        expert: `
            <p>I've reviewed the preliminary autopsy findings in detail. The external examination showed no signs of trauma, struggle, or forced ingestion — which initially supported the assumption of natural causes. However, the toxicology results tell a very different story.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-danger">
                Cause of Death: Acute poisoning. Toxicology indicates the presence of <strong>Aconitine</strong> — a lethal alkaloid derived from the plant Aconitum, commonly known as <strong>Wolfsbane</strong> or <strong>Monkshood</strong>. Concentration levels in the blood are consistent with a single, deliberate oral dose.
            </div>
            
            <p>Aconitine is extraordinarily dangerous — among the most potent plant-based poisons known to medicine. It disrupts sodium channels in nerve and heart tissue, causing progressive paralysis of the cardiac muscle. Based on the concentration found, the victim would have experienced initial tingling or numbness in the mouth and throat within minutes of ingestion, followed by increasing weakness, nausea, and a sense of dread. Within two to six hours, complete cardiac arrest.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                This was not natural causes. This was not an accident. The dose was precise and deliberate — someone with knowledge of the poison administered it orally, almost certainly dissolved into food or drink. William Thoreson was murdered.
            </div>
            
            <p>One additional note of medical significance: Aconitine leaves very little trace and is easily missed in a standard examination. Had this autopsy not included a full toxicology panel, the death would likely have been ruled cardiac failure. Whoever chose this poison knew exactly what they were doing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Aconitine is derived from Wolfsbane, a plant that grows wild in the mountainous regions of Europe — particularly the Alps of Switzerland, Austria, and Northern Italy.</p>

Two outside investors who had put money into Thoreson Toys have been demanding a meeting with Will for months.",
        expert: `
            <p>I've been looking over the Thoreson Toys bank statements. Most of this is what you'd expect — weekly sales deposits, payroll, vendor payments. The company's been running steady for years. But a few things caught my eye.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-highlight">
                First — right at the top of the statement, January 2nd. Two outside investors deposited money into the company account. <strong>Investor Account 7714-A put in $3,000</strong> and <strong>Investor Account 7722-B put in $2,500</strong>. That's $5,500 of other people's money that Will was managing.
            </div>
            
            <p>Then in March, there's a wire transfer for <strong>$8,000</strong> sent to a company called <strong>Kessler & Braun European Distributors</strong> out of Hamburg, Germany. Looks like Will was trying to break into overseas markets — European toy distribution. That's a big swing for a company this size. The account dropped from $22,000 down to about $14,000 overnight.</p>
            
            <p>Six weeks later, Kessler & Braun's account was dissolved. There's a write-down on the books for the full $8,000 — total loss. No recovered funds, nothing coming back. Just gone.</p>
            
            <div class="reveal-danger">
                Now here's where it gets interesting. After the loss hit the books, both of those investors started sending demand letters. Then meeting requests. Then <em>more</em> meeting requests. Then one of them got their attorney involved. Months of correspondence, and Will kept pushing them off. Somebody lost real money because of Will's decision, and they've been trying to get answers for months.
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>The question is — who are these two investors, and are they here tonight?</strong></p>
