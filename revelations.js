Thomas Bradford claims that a spring-loaded mechanism used in Thoreson Toys' newest line was patented by his company in 1931. He demands compensation or threatens litigation.

The document describes the purpose as 'the manufacture and sale of children's playthings.' Both signatures are present and notarized.

The notary stamp belongs to a James P. Whitmore, who has no record in Dallas County's notary registry. Will transferred 100% of Thoreson & Hartley Toys to himself using a document Robert never signed."

An Accounting expert can confirm these payments were never disclosed to the board or reflected in any official company record. Over 24 years, the total paid out exceeds $14,000.

A French speaker can reveal its contents: Margaret tells Will that she cannot forgive him for what he did to Robert, and that what he owes her children cannot be paid with money. She mentions that she left something for Will in 'the place he knows' — believed to refer to the safe in the study closet. The combination, she says, 'is the date he chose to forget.'"
